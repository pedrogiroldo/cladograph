## üìñ About The Project

Cladograph is a web-based application that allows users to create, visualize, and share phylogenetic trees. The project started as a Python application (v1), which was later rewritten using Electron. The current version is a modern web application with a Next.js frontend and a NestJS backend, providing a more robust and scalable solution.

The main goal of Cladograph is to provide a user-friendly tool for students, teachers, and researchers to explore evolutionary relationships between different species.

### üìú Project History

*   **v1 (Python):** The first version of Cladograph was a desktop application built with Python. It was a complete but limited application.
*   **Electron (Deprecated):** An attempt was made to rewrite the application using Electron to create a cross-platform desktop application. However, this version was never completed.
*   **Current Version (Web Application):** The current and actively developed version is a web application with a Next.js frontend and a NestJS backend. This architecture provides a modern, fast, and scalable platform for the future of Cladograph.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pedrogiroldo/cladograph.git
    cd cladograph
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd apps/backend
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    yarn install
    ```

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd apps/backend
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file** by copying the example file:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Edit the `.env` file** with your PostgreSQL database connection string:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
    ```

4.  **Run the database migrations:**
    ```sh
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```sh
    cd apps/backend
    yarn start:dev
    ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Start the frontend server:**
    ```sh
    cd apps/frontend
